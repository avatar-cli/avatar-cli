## Introduction

Avatar-CLI is a statically-liked single-binary command line tool meant to ease
the development forkflow in many ways:
  - Making possible version-pinning for any kind of tool used in any kind of
    project. No need for complex setups or ultra-specific tools like
    [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm),
    [`nodenev`](https://ekalinin.github.io/nodeenv/),
    [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv),
    [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv),
    [`goenv`](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv),
    [`asdf-vm`](https://asdf-vm.com), ... I guess you already have seen the
    pattern.
  - Making possible for new contributors to be productive from the very first
    minute, reducing the bootstrap/setup time to almost zero. Only `git` and
    `docker` are required (in a way, not even `avatar-cli` is required! ðŸ˜‰).

## How to install Avatar-CLI

For now, Avatar-CLI is only available in its source code form, or via `cargo`.
The recommended way to install is is using this command:
```bash
cargo install avatar-cli
```

If you don't have `cargo` in your system, you can obtain it via
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

In future releases, pre-compiled binaries will be provided too.

## How to use Avatar-CLI

In the command line:
```bash
# 1. Enter into your project directory
cd /your/project/path

# 2. Initialize Avatar-CLI for this project, this will create a new config
#    file.
avatar init

# 3. Edit the generated configuration file, without modifying its
#    `internalProjectId` property. You can see an example in the next code
#    block of this text.

# 4. Now you can enter into an Avatar-CLI subshell and use all the configured
#    tools. If, for example, you configured a specific version of NodeJS, then
#    it will be available inside that subshell.
avatar shell

# Now you can use nodejs 14, even if it was not installed in your system
```

Configuration example:
```yaml
---
 # This is of no use... for now, but it must be there
version: '0.10.2'

# Keep the value generated by `avatar init`, don't share it across projects
projectInternalId: v2ZmtbkGuVdvGwVE

images:
  # Image name
  node:
    # Image tag
    14-buster:
      binaries:
        # This configuration will be simplified in versions to come
        node:
          path: node
        npm:
          path: npm
        npx:
          path: npx
        yarn:
          path: yarn
```
