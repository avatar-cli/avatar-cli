# Avatar CLI

## Introduction

Avatar-CLI is a statically-liked single-binary command line tool meant to ease
the development forkflow in many ways:
  - Making possible version-pinning for any kind of tool used in any kind of
    project. No need for complex setups or ultra-specific tools like
    [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm),
    [`nodenev`](https://ekalinin.github.io/nodeenv/),
    [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv),
    [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv),
    [`goenv`](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv),
    [`asdf-vm`](https://asdf-vm.com), ... I guess you already have seen the
    pattern.
  - Making possible for new contributors to be productive from the very first
    minute, reducing the bootstrap/setup time to almost zero. Only `git` and
    `docker` are required (in a way, not even `avatar-cli` is required! ðŸ˜‰).
